# Consultant Booking Application

This is an application that helps students and other people book a consultation session with a consultant from the department staff. This application manages the schedule of consultations and ensures that no two consultations with the same consultant overlap in time.

The user enters the website, and then logins to his account. The user then sees a list of consultants that he can book a consultation with. After that, the user selects a consultant and gets prompted with the available time for consultations for said consultant.
The user then chooses a time and books the session.
The user will be able to see a list of his bookings (somewhere) in the website.
The user can cancel the consultation session.

Each consultant has specific experience and specialization. These information are displayed (somewhere) to help the student select the right consultant.
